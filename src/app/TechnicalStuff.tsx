          I started out my journey in frontend web development, and I have
          experience building websites using React, as well as the
          meta-frameworks built around it. I prefer to use Next.js and
          TypeScript.

          On the backend, I build most of my projects using Node.js and
          Express.js. However, I have also worked with Python&apos;s FastAPI and
          Golang&apos;s Gin.

          I am interested in distributed systems and making sure they are
          scalable.
