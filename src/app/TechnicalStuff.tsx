          I started out my journey in frontend web development, and I have
          experience building websites using React, as well as the
          meta-frameworks built around it. I prefer to use Next.js and
          TypeScript.

          On the backend, I build projects with a variety of languages and
          frameworks, ranging from Node.js, to Python, to Golang. I have greatly
          enjoyed the developer experience of Python&lsquo;s FastAPI and
          Golang&lsquo;s Fiber.

          I am also deeply interested in software architecture and making sure
          they are scalable. I am always looking for ways to improve how I do
          things. Whether it is through using new technologies or adopting new
          practices.
