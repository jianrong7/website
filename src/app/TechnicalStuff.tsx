          I started out my journey in frontend web development, and I have
          experience building websites using React, as well as the
          meta-frameworks built around it. I prefer to use Next.js and
          TypeScript.

        <li className="mb-2">
          On the backend, I build projects with a variety of languages and
          frameworks, ranging from Node.js, to Python, to Golang. I would say
          Python&apos;s FastAPI has provided me with the best developer
          experience so far.

          I am also deeply interested in software architecture and making sure
          they are scalable. I prefer to find the right tool for the job,
          instead of trying to force-fit microservices into every project I do.

          I have also recently tried out prompt engineering, a passion fueled by
          the arrival of ChatGPT, the release of Meta&apos;s LLM, Llama2, and
          the rising popularity of LangChain.
